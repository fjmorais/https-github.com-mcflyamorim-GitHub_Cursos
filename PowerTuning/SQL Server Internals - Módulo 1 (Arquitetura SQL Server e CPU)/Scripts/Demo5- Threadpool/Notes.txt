1 - Threadpool ... This wait type is when there are no available threads in the server’s thread pool, which can lead to login failures or queries not being able to run.
2 - Run SQLQueryStress with 50 threads and 5 iterations... so far so good... 
3 - Run SQLQueryStress with 150 threads and 5 iterations... some queries will fail...

4 - Check DMV sys.dm_os_wait_stats

dbcc sqlperf('sys.dm_os_wait_stats' , CLEAR)
go
select wait_type, waiting_tasks_count, cast((cast(wait_time_ms as float)/waiting_tasks_count) as float) as avg_wait_time_ms, 
wait_time_ms, signal_wait_time_ms
from sys.dm_os_wait_stats
where wait_type = 'THREADPOOL'
AND waiting_tasks_count > 0
go


5 - Create xEvent to capture ThreadPool information... Check duration for each wait event...
